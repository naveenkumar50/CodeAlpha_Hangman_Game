This project is a simple command-line Hangman game implemented in Python. It's designed as a beginner-friendly project to practice basic programming concepts such as:

Loops (for repeated guessing)

Conditionals (to check correct or incorrect guesses)

Strings and Lists (to manage the word and guessed letters)

User Input Handling (to interact with the player)

Random Selection (to choose a word from the list)

The game begins by selecting a random word from a predefined list. The player is then asked to guess the word one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, the number of remaining tries decreases. The game ends when either the player successfully guesses all letters in the word or runs out of tries.

This project can be a great foundation for building more advanced games or learning how to structure terminal applications in Python.
